# Product Semantic Search with Streamlit UI by Azure OpenAI Embedding model (text-embedding-ada-002)

In past code repo, ["Semantic Search by Azure OpenAI Embedding model (text-embedding-ada-002)"](https://github.com/easonlai/azure_openai_semantic_search_sample), it demonstrates how to use the word embedding model from [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) to perform a semantic search on a grocery store dataset. The dataset contains 50 items with their names only. The [word embedding model (text-embedding-ada-002)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings-models-1) converts the items and search terms into high-dimensional vectors and computes their cosine similarity.

This enhanced/completed version used [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build a web user experience to semantic search and display the most relevant items.
